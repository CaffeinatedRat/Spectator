===========

An experimental static WebGL client and WebSocketService extension for Minecraft.
This bukkit plug-in is an extension of the [WebSocketServices] (http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/websocketservices/) plug-in.
Extensions are plug-ins that utilitize the WebSocketServices server on a Minecraft server to perform light-weight client-server communication using the new HTML5 WebSocket protocol.
